## Repo Structure
The notebooks called pre-processing found in the folder pre-preprocessing are the different workes used for the translation progress. The cells inside carry documentation.

The exploration notebook is used to produced all plots and is internally structured.

I used Python 3.8 and the libraries are all clearly marked in the first cell of each notebook
